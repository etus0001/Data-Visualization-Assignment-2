      <h2>Indigenous Languages Across Australia</h2>
      <div id="austlang-map" class="viz"></div>
      <p class="insight">
        <strong>Insight:</strong> The map illustrates the distribution of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages across Australia.
A clear pattern emerges: the northern and central regions—particularly the Northern Territory, Queensland, and parts of Western Australia—show a dense concentration of Indigenous languages, representing areas where traditional languages remain strong.
In contrast, southern and southeastern states display far fewer points, reflecting the greater impact of colonisation and language displacement in these regions.
Overall, the visual highlights a north-to-south decline in language density, underscoring both the rich linguistic diversity of Indigenous Australia and the ongoing need for language revitalisation and preservation efforts.

      <h2>Language Spoken/Used at Home (1991–2021)</h2>
      <div id="language-line" class="viz"></div>
      <p class="insight">
  The line graph displays the distribution of language use for the selected census year.
  Across the period (1991–2021), Australian Indigenous language use declines (from
  about <strong>16.4%</strong> to <strong>9.5%</strong>), while English increases (from
  <strong>78.9%</strong> to <strong>84.1%</strong>). “Other language” remains consistently low and
  “Not stated” fluctuates slightly. The pattern indicates a gradual shift toward English
  in daily communication and highlights the importance of ongoing language
  revitalisation efforts for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.

      <h2>Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Population (2011–2021)</h2>
      <div id="population-bar" class="viz"></div>
      <p class="insight">
        <strong>Insight:</strong> The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population grew from
        <strong>806,090</strong> in <strong>2011</strong> to <strong>983,709</strong> in <strong>2021</strong> —
        an increase of about <strong>177,619</strong> people (~<strong>22%</strong>). Growth is steady year-over-year
        (no declines), averaging roughly <strong>~17.7k</strong> additional people per year, with the largest
        annual jump between 2011 and 2012.
